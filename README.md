# Stack Overflow Programming Language Trends Analysis with R

**Case study realised using R to analyze the changing popularity trends of programming languages over time based on Stack Overflow data. The project investigates the percentage of questions tagged with "R", identifies the most popular tags, and analyzes year-over-year changes in programming language trends.**

## Description
In this project, we analyze the trends in the popularity of programming languages on Stack Overflow over time. By examining questions tagged with various programming languages, including "R", we uncover how the relative popularity of these languages has evolved between 2015 and 2020. The analysis focuses on "R" and explores its percentage of total questions, identifies the most asked-about programming languages, and determines which tag experienced the largest year-over-year increase in its percentage of questions.

**Note:** The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Stack Overflow and cannot be shared publicly.
